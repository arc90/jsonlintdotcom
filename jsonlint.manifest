CACHE MANIFEST

# When updating any resources, you must bump this manifest file in
# some way. The browser will only attempt to update resources if this
# fileâ€™s content (i.e., the bytes, HTTP headers are irrelevant in this
# situation) actually changes. The conventional means to do this with
# static content is to include a revision number inside of the
# manifest as a comment:
#
# revision=0

# Normal static resources

FALLBACK:
# Special, GET parameters are parsed locally anyways so allow them to
# work. We can only catch these URIs with fallback namespaces though,
# so the browser takes a while to load them (however long the
# connection/name resolution attempt takes to fail) as it first tries
# to access the website directly before falling back.
/? index.html
/index.html? index.html

# Enable access to proxy.php, Google Analytics, and allow linking to
# external websites. Will only work when the client is connected to
# the Internet.
